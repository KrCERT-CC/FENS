The new wiper follows this pattern by wiping out user data and partition information. However, ESET says that CaddyWiper does avoid erasing information on domain controllers.</a>

### DoubleZero
> <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/threat-advisory-doublezero.html">DoubleZero is a .NET-based implant that destroys files, registry keys and trees on the infected endpoint. This wiper was detected as early as March 17, 2022. DoubleZero is yet another wiper discovered in addition to previously disclosed attacks we've seen in Ukraine over the past two months, such as "CaddyWiper" "HermeticWiper" and "WhisperGate."</a>

### HeaderTip
> <a href="https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/04/threat-thursday-headertip-backdoor-shows-attackers-from-china-preying-on-ukraine.">Known as HeaderTip, this backdoor is thought to be tied to an APT group named Scarab, which has been linked to China. Scarab has targeted the U.S. and Russia in the past, but HeaderTip is the threat group’s first attack that we’ve seen specifically targeting Ukraine post invasion. This makes it one of the first examples of attackers linked to China actively exploiting the current situation in Ukraine</a>

### HermeticRansom
> <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/">ESET researchers also observed HermeticRansom – ransomware written in Go – being used in Ukraine at the same time as the HermeticWiper campaign. HermeticRansom was first reported in the early hours of February 24th, 2022 UTC, in a tweet from AVAST. This ransomware was deployed at the same time as HermeticWiper, potentially in order to hide the wiper’s actions.</a>

### HermeticWiper
> <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2022/03/hermeticwiper-a-detailed-analysis-of-the-destructive-malware-that-targeted-ukraine">This malware was given the name "HermeticWiper" based on a stolen digital certificate from a company called Hermetica Digital Ltd. This wiper is remarkable for its ability to bypass Windows security features and gain write access to many low-level data-structures on the disk. In addition, the attackers wanted to fragment files on disk and overwrite them to make recovery impossible.</a>

### HermeticWizard
> <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/">HermeticWizard spreads HermeticWiper across a local network via WMI and SMB. HermeticWizard tries to find other machines on the local network. When it has found a reachable machine, it drops the WMI(SMB) spreader on disk and creates a new process with the command line. Finally, it drops HermeticWiper and executes it.</a>

### IsaacWiper
> <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/">On February 24th, 2022, we detected yet another new wiper in a Ukrainian governmental network. We named it IsaacWiper and we are currently assessing its links, if any, with HermeticWiper. It is important to note that it was seen in an organization that was not affected by HermeticWiper.</a>

### Katana Botnet
> <a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/technical-analysis-of-the-ddos-attacks-against-ukrainian-websites/">Last week the websites for several banks and government organisations in Ukraine were hit with a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack. Below we identify the likely source of the attacks as a botnet called Katana, with preparation for the attack starting at least as early as Sunday 13th February. Katana is a fork of Mirai, originally available for purchase for 500 Euros but now freely available online:</a>

### LoadEdge
> <a href="">Drawing conclusions from the ESET research paper, LoadEdge resembles an upgraded version of InvisiMole's TCP downloader component used to download further backdoor modules called RC2FM and RC2CL, usually deployed as the first payload on a newly compromised computer. InvisiMole's RC2FM and RC2CL backdoors provide extended surveillance capabilities such as screen, webcam and microphone captures, documents exfiltration, collecting network information, and information about installed software.</a>

### MicroBackdoor
> <a href="https://github.com/Cr4sh/MicroBackdoor">MicroBackdoor is C2 tool for Windows targets with easy customizable code base and small footprint. Micro Backdoor consists from server, client and dropper. It wasn't designed as replacement for your favorite post-exploitation tools but rather as really minimalistic thing with all of the basic features in less than 5000 lines of code, client DLL size is less than 20Kb without compression.</a>

### PseudoSteel
> <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin#blta21a05bf729b4798_en-us">Phishing attacks using PseudoSteel have recently been observed targeting Ukrainian State authorities. The attack uses document files claiming to be about losses of Ukrainian servicemen. These install PseudoSteel which can be used to search for and upload local documents and archive files.</a>

### WhisperGate
> <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-057a"> Microsoft announced the identification of a sophisticated malware operation targeting multiple organizations in Ukraine. The malware, known as WhisperGate, has two stages that corrupts a system’s master boot record, displays a fake ransomware note, and encrypts files based on certain file extensions </a>
